    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 2025</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our app collects, uses, and safeguards your information, including your posts (“beacons”), interactions with other users, and data about how you use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Username</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>The core feature of the app is allowing you to post beacons about your mental health. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text you write</li>
      <li>Images or media you attach</li>
      <li>Tags you choose (e.g., anxious, heartbroken, lonely)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other users can view and interact with your beacons (support, comments, boosts).</p>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>Collected only if you grant device permission. Used for features like showing regional trends. Always optional, and you can revoke permission in device settings.</p>

    <h3>Behavioral &amp; Analytics Data</h3>
    <p>We collect information about how you use the app, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Posts you create, like, comment on, or boost</li>
      <li>How you interact with other users</li>
      <li>General app usage data (e.g., screen views, session length, device type)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Analytics data is collected through Google’s Firebase Analytics. This helps us understand app performance and improve user experience. No personally identifiable content from your beacons is linked to Analytics.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the app’s core functionality (posting, comments, boosts, notifications)</li>
      <li>Analyse anonymised data trends to identify patterns in mental health conditions</li>
      <li>Improve and personalise your user experience</li>
      <li>Monitor and enhance app stability, performance, and safety</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Anonymization</h2>
    <p>When analysing mental health trends, we use aggregated and anonymised data that cannot be traced back to you personally. Your personal information (such as email or location) is not linked to these reports.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. Service providers such as Firebase (Google Cloud) process data securely on our behalf. All data is used internally by the Beacon team to improve the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>

    <h3>Access &amp; Deletion of Your Data</h3>
    <p>You can access or permanently delete your account and all associated data in the app’s settings. Once deleted, your personal data, user-generated content, and location data will be permanently erased from our servers.</p>

    <h3>Location Opt-Out</h3>
    <p>You can disable location permissions in your device settings at any time. Some features may be limited without location access.</p>

    <h3>Analytics Consent</h3>
    <p>By signing up and ticking the consent checkbox, you agree to analytics data collection to help us improve the app. You may withdraw consent by deleting your account.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard security practices, including encryption and secure storage via Google Cloud’s Firebase, to safeguard your information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. If material updates are made, we will notify you via the app or by email.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us through the in-app Contact page.</p>
