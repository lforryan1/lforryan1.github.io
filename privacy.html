    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 2024</p>

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how our app collects, uses, and safeguards your personal information, particularly in relation to the mental health beacons you post, the interaction of other users with these beacons, and other data related to your use of the app.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Username</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
</ul>

<h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
<p>The core feature of the app is allowing users to post beacons when they are struggling with their mental health. This content includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The text of the beacon</li>
  <li>Any images or media attached to the beacon</li>
  <li>Tags that categorize the beacon (e.g., anxious, heartbroken, lonely)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other users can view and interact with these beacons by offering support, commenting, or liking posts.</p>

<h3>Location Data</h3>
<p>When you post a beacon, we may collect your location data if you have granted permission for location services. This data helps us offer location-based functionality (e.g., showing trends by region). We only collect location data with your explicit consent through your device's location permissions settings.</p>

<h3>Behavioral Data</h3>
<p>We may collect data on how you interact with the app, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Posts you create, like, or comment on</li>
  <li>User interactions and engagement patterns</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide and maintain core functionality (e.g., posting beacons, user interactions)</li>
  <li>To analyse aggregated and anonymised data trends to help identify patterns in mental health conditions</li>
  <li>To enhance and improve user experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Anonymization</h2>
<p>All data used to analyse mental health trends is aggregated and anonymised and cannot be traced back to individual users. Your personal data (such as email address and location) will not be linked to these trend reports.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal data or any user-generated content with third parties. All the data is used internally by the Beacon team to improve the app's functionality and user experience.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>

<h3>Access and Deletion of Your Data</h3>
<p>You have the right to access and delete all data associated with your account. If you wish to delete your account, you can do so from the app settings. Once deleted, all your personal data, user-generated content, and location data will be permanently erased from our servers.</p>

<h3>Opt-Out of Location Services</h3>
<p>You can opt out of location data collection at any time by disabling location services in your device settings. This may affect your ability to use some features.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard security practices, including encryption and secure storage (via Google Cloud’s Firebase), to safeguard your personal information.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. If there are any material changes, we will notify you via the app or by email.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us via the Contact page.</p>
